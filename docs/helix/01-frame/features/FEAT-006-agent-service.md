# Feature: DDx Agent Service (consumer of ddx-agent contract)

**ID:** FEAT-006
**Status:** In Progress (migrating to ddx-agent CONTRACT-003)
**Priority:** P0
**Owner:** DDx Team

## Overview

DDx invokes LLMs through the `ddx-agent` module, defined by
**CONTRACT-003-ddx-agent-service** in the `~/Projects/agent` repo
(`docs/helix/02-design/contracts/CONTRACT-003-ddx-agent-service.md`).

That contract is the entire boundary. DDx's CLI commands (`ddx agent run`,
`ddx agent execute-bead`, `ddx work`, `ddx agent providers`, `ddx agent models`,
`ddx agent route-status`, `ddx agent check`) are thin wrappers that call into
the `agentlib.DdxAgent` interface and render its results.

## DDx-side responsibilities

DDx owns the bead-driven workflow surface. It does NOT own:
- Harness orchestration (claude, codex, opencode, pi, gemini, native)
- Provider routing
- Model catalog
- Compaction
- Tool registration
- Session-log shape

Those all live inside ddx-agent per CONTRACT-003.

DDx owns:

- **Bead-driven invocation.** `ddx agent execute-bead`, `ddx work`, and the
  server's queue-drain worker translate bead state into `ExecuteRequest`
  values and surface results back into the bead tracker.
- **Execute-bead orchestration.** Worktree creation, base-revision pinning,
  result landing (merge / preserve / no-changes), gate evaluation, evidence
  bundle capture. The agent provides the LLM execution; DDx provides the
  git-aware orchestration.
- **Evidence and session capture.** DDx writes `.ddx/executions/<id>/`
  bundles with prompts, manifests, and result artifacts. The agent's session
  log path (returned in `ExecuteResponse.SessionLogPath`) is captured into
  the bundle.
- **Profile policy at the request level.** DDx selects `Profile`, `Effort`,
  `Permissions` per bead (or per CLI invocation) based on bead metadata
  and user input. The agent receives those as `ExecuteRequest` fields and
  performs the routing.

## Asking ddx-agent for changes

When DDx needs new behavior from the agent — a new method, a new field on
`ExecuteRequest`, a new event type, a new policy knob — file a PR against
CONTRACT-003 in the agent repo. Maintainers decide whether the surface grows.

Do not import agent internal packages. They live under `internal/` and the
Go compiler blocks external imports after agent v0.5.0 ships.

## Migration status

DDx is currently migrating from the legacy DDx-internal routing/harness
implementation to the CONTRACT-003 surface. Migration epic: `ddx-ac5c7fdb`.
Pre-migration, FEAT-006 documented harness orchestration responsibilities
that have since moved upstream.
