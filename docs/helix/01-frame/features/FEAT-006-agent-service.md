# Feature: DDx Agent Service (consumer of ddx-agent contract)

**ID:** FEAT-006
**Status:** In Progress (migrating to ddx-agent CONTRACT-003)
**Priority:** P0
**Owner:** DDx Team

## Overview

DDx invokes LLMs through the `ddx-agent` module, defined by
**CONTRACT-003-ddx-agent-service** in the `~/Projects/agent` repo
(`docs/helix/02-design/contracts/CONTRACT-003-ddx-agent-service.md`).

That contract is the entire execution boundary. DDx exposes the public
`ddx run` / `ddx try` / `ddx work` layers and calls the upstream
`agentlib.DdxAgent` interface for the actual agent invocation. Upstream
diagnostic/status commands may remain mounted under `ddx agent`, but
`ddx agent run`, `ddx agent execute-bead`, and `ddx agent execute-loop` are not
public workflow commands.

## DDx-side responsibilities

DDx owns the bead-driven workflow surface. It does NOT own:
- Harness orchestration (claude, codex, opencode, pi, gemini, native)
- Provider routing
- Model catalog
- Compaction
- Tool registration
- Session-log shape

Those all live inside ddx-agent per CONTRACT-003.

DDx owns:

- **Bead-driven invocation.** `ddx try`, `ddx work`, and the server's
  queue-drain worker translate bead state into `ExecuteRequest` values and
  surface results back into the bead tracker.
- **Bead-attempt orchestration.** Worktree creation, base-revision pinning,
  result landing (merge / preserve / no-changes), gate evaluation, evidence
  bundle capture. The agent provides the LLM execution; DDx provides the
  git-aware orchestration.
- **Evidence and session capture.** DDx writes `.ddx/executions/<id>/`
  bundles with prompts, manifests, and result artifacts. The agent's session
  log path (returned in `ExecuteResponse.SessionLogPath`) is captured into
  the bundle.
- **Power policy at the request level.** DDx selects requested agent power
  bounds, effort, and permissions per bead attempt based on bead metadata, user
  input, and prior attempt outcomes. The agent receives `MinPower` and
  optionally `MaxPower` on `ExecuteRequest` and performs the routing.
- **Agent passthrough constraints.** DDx may accept explicit `--harness`,
  `--provider`, and `--model` values from the operator and pass them unchanged
  to the agent. DDx does not validate, rank, fallback, rewrite, or reason about
  these fields; they are opaque constraints for the agent to interpret.
- **Retry policy.** DDx owns the bead retry loop because DDx owns the evidence
  needed to decide whether an attempt succeeded: commits, merge/preserve
  result, no-changes rationale, post-run gates, review verdicts, cooldowns,
  and prior run metadata. On retry, DDx may raise `MinPower`. The agent owns
  how those power bounds map to a concrete model/provider.

## Power Intent

DDx does not route. DDx chooses request-level power bounds and sends them to
`agentlib.DdxAgent.Execute` as `MinPower` and optional `MaxPower`; the agent
resolves harness, provider, endpoint, model, health, quota, fallback, and route
errors.

Power is an abstract integer scale owned by the agent contract. DDx treats
`MinPower`/`MaxPower` as bounds on that scale, not as model identities. For
example, the agent may report:

```text
running with qwen 3.6-27b (power 10)
```

DDx records requested `MinPower`/`MaxPower` and the actual model/power returned
by the agent. DDx can use that evidence on a later retry to raise `MinPower`,
but it still does not choose the next model.

The agent also exposes its available model/power catalog. DDx may read that
catalog to choose a `MinPower` threshold for "top model only" retries, for
example by requesting a lower bound at or above the lowest power among the
current top models. DDx must not use the catalog to pin a concrete
model/provider on the normal execution path.

DDx may also pass request facts such as estimated prompt size, whether tools are
required, permissions, timeout values, and effort/reasoning intent. These facts
describe the work; they do not select a model.

## Non-Bead Invocation Intent

Not every layer-1 invocation comes from a bead. Artifact generation,
artifact regeneration, prompt comparison skills, and diagnostics can call
`ddx run` directly. For those calls DDx may choose work intent from the
artifact or operation being performed:

- `MinPower` / optional `MaxPower` derived from the artifact's generator,
  media type, size, risk, or explicit operator flags
- permissions needed for the operation, such as read-only, workspace-write, or
  network access
- timeout and effort/reasoning intent
- metadata such as `produces_artifact`, artifact id, execution definition id,
  and governing document ids

These are DDx-owned work facts, not routing decisions. DDx must not translate an
artifact key, media type, generator name, or execution definition into a concrete
harness/provider/model. The only concrete route-like fields DDx may send are
operator-supplied passthrough constraints, carried unchanged in the passthrough
envelope described below.

## Agent Passthrough Constraints

`--harness`, `--provider`, and `--model` are permitted on `ddx run`, `ddx try`,
and `ddx work` only as passthrough fields. DDx carries them in one narrow
request envelope and sends them to `agentlib.DdxAgent.Execute` unchanged.

These fields must not leak into DDx routing policy:

- no DDx-side validation against harness/provider/model catalogs
- no preflight `ResolveRoute`
- no provider/model fallback or substitution
- no retry-policy branches that inspect the string values
- no config-driven default harness/provider/model selection
- no worker columns or queue selection logic that treat these as DDx concepts

If an operator supplies passthrough constraints and DDx later retries with a
higher `MinPower`, DDx keeps the passthrough values unchanged. The agent
decides whether the power bounds and passthrough constraints are compatible and
reports the actual model/power or a typed error. DDx records the requested
passthrough values for audit, but it does not use them to select a route.

When hard passthrough pins make the requested power bounds unsatisfiable, DDx
must stop with a typed terminal classification such as
`blocked_by_passthrough_constraint` or `agent_power_unsatisfied`. DDx records
the requested `MinPower`/`MaxPower`, passthrough envelope, and agent-supplied
evidence, then reports operator action required. DDx must not remove pins,
choose alternatives, call `ResolveRoute` to work around the conflict, or loop on
higher `MinPower` values.

The only DDx code allowed to touch raw passthrough fields is the CLI parser, the
single passthrough/intent value, Execute request construction, execution-record
persistence, and human-facing evidence rendering. Retry, queue selection, work
scheduling, catalog threshold helpers, and config defaulting must carry the
opaque value without reading `Harness`, `Provider`, or `Model`.

`ResolveRoute` is not part of normal execution. It is allowed only for
operator-facing status/debug surfaces such as route-status and provider
diagnostics. A `RouteDecision` returned by `ResolveRoute` must never be
re-injected into `Execute`.

`agent.routing.profile_ladders`, `agent.routing.model_overrides`,
`agent.routing.profile_priority`, and the `cheap`/`standard`/`smart` profile
taxonomy are not DDx execution policy. Configs or tests that rely on DDx-managed
ladders, profiles, or model overrides are migration debt.

## Catalog and Status Boundary

Model/power catalog rendering is observability. Catalog status surfaces may show
model names, providers, powers, and route candidates returned by the agent for
debugging. Retry threshold policy may consume only abstract power numbers from
the catalog to compute `MinPower` thresholds. Neither status nor retry code may
return or mutate concrete harness/provider/model pins for execution.

## Session Log Envelope Boundary

The upstream agent owns the native session-log schema and any harness-specific
details inside it. DDx owns only the envelope around that log:

- request id, layer, parent run id, bead id or produced artifact id
- requested `MinPower` / `MaxPower` and opaque passthrough constraints
- actual model and actual power returned by the agent
- pointer or copied attachment for `ExecuteResponse.SessionLogPath`
- DDx-owned attempt outcome, merge/preserve outcome, gates, and evidence refs

DDx may render or link the session log for humans, but normal execution policy
must not parse the inner session log to infer routing, provider health, model
fallbacks, or retry destinations. Typed agent response fields and DDx-owned
attempt evidence are the policy inputs.

## Layer Ownership Migration Table

FEAT-006 is deliberately narrow after the three-layer refactor. It describes
how DDx consumes the upstream agent contract and how layer-1 requests are
formed; it does not own worktree, queue, or CLI namespace design.

| Area | Owner after migration |
| --- | --- |
| CONTRACT-003 `agentlib.DdxAgent` boundary, `ExecuteRequest` / `ExecuteResponse` consumption, `MinPower` / `MaxPower`, actual model/power recording | Stays in FEAT-006 |
| Opaque passthrough envelope for `--harness`, `--provider`, `--model` and the rule that DDx must not route on those fields | Stays in FEAT-006 |
| Non-bead layer-1 invocation intent: artifact-keyed power bounds, permissions, timeout, effort, and metadata | Stays in FEAT-006 |
| Session-log envelope and pointer/copy capture around the agent-owned inner log | Stays in FEAT-006 |
| Worktree creation, base revision pinning, bead prompt resolution, result landing, preserve refs, post-run gates, evidence bundles | Moves to FEAT-010 layer 2 (`ddx try`) |
| Unified `.ddx/runs/<run-id>/` substrate, layer metadata, child/parent run links, migration from `.ddx/exec-runs/` and `.ddx/executions/` | Moves to FEAT-010 |
| Queue iteration, no-progress detection, retry scheduling, cooldowns, stop conditions, loop records | Moves to FEAT-010 layer 3 (`ddx work`) |
| Public top-level command shape: `ddx run`, `ddx try`, `ddx work`, `ddx runs`, `ddx tries`, `ddx work workers` | Moves to FEAT-001 |
| Structural mounting of the upstream agent Cobra root under `ddx agent` and hard-deprecation redirects for legacy DDx workflow commands | Moves to FEAT-001, with the contract boundary referenced here |

### Conflict-recovery structured outcomes (bead ddx-0097af14)

Before parking a bead on `land_conflict` (or on `execution_failed` when the
agent produced a commit before failing), the `ddx work` drain now attempts to reuse
the preserved iteration ref rather than discarding the agent's work:

1. **3-way ort auto-merge** (`git merge --no-ff -s ort -X ours`). If clean,
   the bead closes as `success`.
2. **Focused conflict-resolve agent** (if `ConflictResolver` is configured on
   the worker). If clean, the bead closes as `success`.
3. **Park with structured outcome.** Two new statuses replace the generic
   reopen when both recovery paths fail:

| Status | Event kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `land_conflict_unresolvable` | `land-conflict-unresolvable` | All auto-recovery failed; retryable after 15-min cooldown. |
| `land_conflict_needs_human` | `land-conflict-needs-human` | Focused-resolve agent returned BLOCKING; human input required. |

Both statuses use `LandConflictCooldown` (15 min) rather than the 24h cap used
for `push_failed`, because land conflicts typically unblock quickly as sibling
beads advance the base branch.

## Bead-Attempt Worker Sub-task Discovery Policy

**Design position: option (b) — surface via result.**

Workers executing inside `ddx try` / `ddx work` bead attempts MUST NOT call
`ddx bead create`
in-band during their execution run. Creating beads in-band (option c) allows a
single worker to flood the queue with unreviewed children — in one observed case
(ddx-44236615), one worker spawned 11 P0 children without operator review. This
violates the architectural principle from FEAT-013: *"DDx provides primitives,
not orchestration. Orchestration policy stays in HELIX and other workflow tools."*

Workers MAY surface discovered sub-tasks as structured data in `result.json`
under a `discovered_subtasks` array. Each entry is a lightweight object with at
minimum a `title` and optional `description`, `labels`, and `priority` fields.
The `ddx work` drain or supervisor reads this array from the result bundle and passes
it to the workflow tool (HELIX or operator) for decomposition decisions. The
supervisor decides whether, when, and at what priority to file new beads — DDx
does not do this automatically.

### Rationale

| Option | Description | Problem |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (a) Append to parent | Worker writes sub-tasks as notes or events on the parent bead | Loses structure; sub-tasks are not queryable or executable without manual decomposition |
| (b) Surface via result (**chosen**) | Agent emits `discovered_subtasks` in result.json; supervisor decides | Gates tracker mutations at an explicit decision point; aligns with "primitives not orchestration" |
| (c) Create in-band (former behavior) | Worker calls `ddx bead create` directly | Unreviewed children flood the queue; P0 tagging without operator review; violates workflow ownership boundary |

Option (b) preserves the operator control point required by workflow tools while
providing structure that automation can act on. It is the only option consistent
with the FEAT-013 boundary.

### Result schema extension

`result.json` gains an optional `discovered_subtasks` array. The bead-attempt
orchestrator writes it from the agent's structured output when present. The
supervisor MUST NOT act on this field automatically; it is surfaced as an
observation for the workflow tool.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "detail": "...",
  "discovered_subtasks": [
    {
      "title": "Add read-coverage for X",
      "description": "Optional detail about what is needed",
      "labels": ["area:tests"],
      "priority": "P1"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the agent does not emit `discovered_subtasks`, the field is absent. The
`ddx work` drain treats an absent or empty array identically — no automatic bead
creation occurs in either case.

### Enforcement

The bead-attempt prompt delivered to the agent (via the prompt rationalizer)
MUST include an explicit instruction that workers must not call `ddx bead create`
and must instead emit `discovered_subtasks` in their result if sub-tasks are
identified. This constraint is part of the prompt contract; it is not enforced
by the CLI at runtime.

## Malformed-Bead Remediation Decision (beads ddx-7eab13a6 era)

**Decision: close and refile.**

The layer-1 worktree-path bug fixed in ddx-7eab13a6 caused 22 beads to be
created with IDs of the form `.execute-bead-wt-<parent>-<timestamp>-<random>-<hex>`
(the worktree directory path was mistakenly used as the bead ID). These beads
are invalid: their IDs do not match the `ddx-<8hex>` format expected by all DDx
CLI commands, and the IDs appear in git commit trailers as malformed values.

Repair in-place is not safe. Bead IDs are immutable identifiers embedded in git
commit trailers (`Ddx-Attempt-Id` etc.), inter-bead dependency edges, and the
JSONL append-only store. Renaming an existing bead ID requires rewriting
history, which violates the merge policy recorded in project memory.

The operator (human or supervising workflow tool) should:
1. Inspect each malformed bead's description to determine whether the underlying
   work is still valid.
2. If valid: refile a new bead with the same title and description, using
   `ddx bead create`. The new bead will receive a correct ID.
3. Close the malformed bead with `ddx bead close <id> --reason "malformed-id
   refiled as <new-id>"`.
4. If the work is no longer needed: close the malformed bead with reason
   `malformed-id obsolete`.

No automated bulk remediation is performed. The 22 beads are left open pending
operator triage. A future `ddx bead validate` command (not yet implemented) can
flag structurally invalid bead IDs to aid discovery.

## Asking ddx-agent for changes

When DDx needs new behavior from the agent — a new method, a new field on
`ExecuteRequest`, a new event type, a new policy knob — file a PR against
CONTRACT-003 in the agent repo. Maintainers decide whether the surface grows.

Do not import agent internal packages. They live under `internal/` and the
Go compiler blocks external imports after agent v0.5.0 ships.

### Operator-prompt bead type (Story 15)

Free-form prompts submitted from the web UI are persisted as beads with
`issueType: operator-prompt` and drained by the standard execute-loop. The
title is the prompt's first line, the body is the full prompt verbatim,
default labels are `kind:operator-prompt,source:web-ui`, and the AC section
is auto-generated from a template. These beads run with the same
harness/profile/tier as regular beads but skip the structural AC check
(which assumes pre-authored AC). They cannot mutate other operator-prompt
beads — a hard rule enforced at the bead store, not at planning time.

The trust contract, audit-as-bead model, multi-node delegation policy,
prompt-injection threat model, and allowed-mutation scope are captured in
**ADR-021: Operator-Prompt Beads as the Web Write Path**.

## Worker Contract (per ADR-022)

Workers are **long-lived API clients of the server**, not forked
subprocesses with private state. The same client/state-machine code path
serves both `ddx work --local` (with an in-process API implementation) and
server-spawned workers (talking to the HTTP API), parameterised by a
`Transport` interface.

A worker's lifecycle is fully described by six endpoints under
`/api/workers/`:

- `POST /register` — worker presents its `ExecuteLoopSpec`-shaped
  registration payload (project root, harness, model preference, label
  filter, capabilities); receives a `worker_id` and a project-bound
  `session_token`. The registration payload is the **single source of
  truth** for worker configuration; adding a new flag to `ddx work` means
  adding one field here.
- `POST /<id>/heartbeat` — mutual liveness signal; carries the worker's
  state (`idle | claiming | executing | reviewing | draining`); response
  carries a `server_command` (`continue | pause | drain | terminate`).
- `GET /<id>/next-bead` — long-poll claim acquisition. Server picks an
  eligible bead, creates a claim, and returns `{bead, attempt_id,
  base_rev, claim_lease_ms}`. Workers that see a bare `{wait_for_seconds}`
  reissue without exiting; empty queue is **not** a termination signal.
- `POST /<id>/event` — appends to the bead's event log; uses the existing
  bead event `kind`/`body` shape so CLI, MCP, and web-UI readers see
  worker events without code changes.
- `POST /<id>/result` — terminal disposition for an attempt
  (`merged | preserved | no_changes | failed_rejected`), with evidence
  directory and commit SHA. Reconciles against the server-side claim.
- `POST /<id>/disconnect` — graceful shutdown; releases unclaimed lease.

All endpoints require `requireTrusted` (per ADR-006). Session tokens are
project-bound; a worker registered for project A cannot read or write
state for project B even if it possesses a valid token, which prevents
recurrence of the `ddx-4c51d33e` cross-project leak class in worker paths.

**Restart survival** is a property of the design, not a feature:

- If the server restarts, the worker's heartbeat fails. The worker keeps
  executing the in-flight bead in its isolated worktree, marks itself as
  disconnected, and reconnects when the server returns. Late results
  arriving after a heartbeat-timeout reclaim are recorded as dropped
  attempts; the new claim's outcome wins.
- If the worker dies, the server's heartbeat-timeout reclaims the bead
  for another worker after `3× heartbeat_interval`.

The attempt-orchestration responsibilities listed under "DDx-side
responsibilities" above (worktree creation, base-revision pinning, result
landing, evidence capture) all execute **inside the worker process**,
between `next-bead` and `result`. The server holds runtime claim and
heartbeat state but does not run agents itself.

The legacy bipartite execution paths — `cli/internal/agent/execute_bead_loop.go`
and the server's exec-spawn path in `cli/internal/server/workers.go` — are
both replaced by the single worker client + state machine in
`cli/internal/agent/work/`. See ADR-022 for the full contract, sequence
diagrams, compatibility analysis, and implementation roadmap.

## Migration status

DDx is currently migrating from the legacy DDx-internal routing/harness
implementation to the CONTRACT-003 surface. Migration epic: `ddx-ac5c7fdb`.
Pre-migration, FEAT-006 documented harness orchestration responsibilities
that have since moved upstream.
