# ADR-023: Bead Lifecycle Quality Policy

**Status:** Proposed (Accepted after operator review)
**Date:** 2026-05-04
**Authors:** bead `ddx-9210f95a`

## Context

Reliability principle P7 ("BEAD = PROMPT") is planned in
`docs/helix/06-iterate/reliability-principles.md` by bead `ddx-06b77652`.
The principle says a bead's description and acceptance criteria must be enough
for a competent sub-agent to execute without hand-curation, but it does not
define the enforcement mechanism, waiver model, staged rollout, or recovery UX.

The quality gap is already visible in evidence:

- Audit 1, `.ddx/executions/20260503T195715-4725673a/bead-quality-audit-2026-05-03.md`,
  found repeated misses in root-cause detail, concrete test names, and
  self-contained scope.
- Audit 1 snapshot,
  `.ddx/executions/20260503T155638-bead57f0cb9e/bead-quality-audit-2026-05-03.md`,
  directly operationalizes P7 and records the first 20-bead scoring pass.
- Audit 2,
  `.ddx/executions/20260504T030000-audit2/bead-quality-audit-remaining-2026-05-04.md`,
  extended the scan across the remaining open queue and calls out evidence bead
  `ddx-f339c399`.
- `docs/helix/06-iterate/bead-authoring-template.md` is the canonical
  8-criterion authoring rubric and explicitly defines valid criterion skips for
  epic, doc-only, deletion, and rename beads.

Three existing feature specs already own the affected surfaces:

- FEAT-004 owns bead schema, validation hooks, labels, and evidence.
- FEAT-010 owns `ddx try`, `ddx work`, run records, and attempt outcomes.
- FEAT-011 owns the DDx skill packaging model that gives agents reusable
  workflow guidance.

## Decision

DDx adopts bead-lifecycle quality enforcement as policy over the existing
bead, execution, and skill surfaces. No new bead schema fields are introduced.
No new top-level FEAT is created.

### Policy

Every automated bead attempt has two quality checkpoints:

1. **Pre-dispatch lint.** Before `ddx try` launches the agent invocation for a
   bead, DDx evaluates the bead description, acceptance criteria, labels,
   parent, and dependency metadata against the canonical rubric in
   `docs/helix/06-iterate/bead-authoring-template.md`.
2. **Post-attempt triage.** After an attempt finalizes, DDx triages the result
   against the same lifecycle quality policy so a low-quality prompt failure,
   missing rationale, empty review block, or structurally ambiguous outcome is
   classified and surfaced consistently.

Both checkpoints invoke the same nested bead-lifecycle workflow skill under the
`ddx` skill tree. The skill is responsible for translating the rubric into
agent-readable findings; DDx remains responsible for hook timing, evidence
placement, and outcome classification.

### Staged Rollout

The default rollout is WARN-ONLY.

- WARN-ONLY mode reports the lint score, missing criteria, waiver matches, and
  suggested remediation, then proceeds with dispatch.
- BLOCK mode is opt-in until the queue baseline confirms that ordinary
  execution-ready beads can consistently satisfy the rubric.
- BLOCK mode may stop only on a valid low lint score after applicable rubric
  skips and label waivers are applied. It must not stop on hook crashes,
  missing skill files, transient filesystem errors, or malformed lint output.

This makes the policy measurable before it becomes a dispatch gate and avoids
freezing the queue while legacy beads are being retrofitted.

### Waiver Model

Waivers exist at two levels:

- **Rubric-level by bead type.** The skips documented in
  `docs/helix/06-iterate/bead-authoring-template.md` are built into lint:
  doc-only beads may omit criterion (c) and (d), epic beads may satisfy those
  criteria through children, and pure deletion or rename beads may omit
  criterion (d) while preserving behavior.
- **Per-bead labels.** Rare exceptions use labels of the form
  `lint-waiver:<criterion>`, for example `lint-waiver:c`. Labels are the
  durable waiver store because FEAT-004 already defines labels as free-form
  bead metadata and no schema change is warranted.

Operator override uses `--force --reason <text>`. The override records an event
in the bead evidence stream naming the criterion, mode, actor, reason, and lint
summary. It does not silently bypass the hook and it does not mutate the rubric.

### Fail-Open Behavior

The lifecycle hooks follow reliability principle P1's fail-open posture for
infrastructure failures.

- If the hook cannot run, the workflow skill is missing, output cannot be
  parsed, or evidence cannot be written, DDx records the infrastructure failure
  and proceeds.
- In WARN-ONLY mode, all valid lint results proceed after reporting.
- In BLOCK mode, only a valid post-waiver lint result below the configured
  threshold blocks dispatch.
- Post-attempt triage failures never erase the attempt result. They annotate the
  report and evidence so retry policy and operators can distinguish "agent made
  a bad attempt" from "quality infrastructure failed."

### Recovery UX

When BLOCK mode stops dispatch, the operator-facing output must be actionable.
It prints:

- bead id, score, mode, and blocked criteria
- the missing fields or malformed sections in plain language
- the waiver labels already applied and the labels that would waive each
  failed criterion
- suggested `ddx bead update` commands for adding description, acceptance,
  labels, parent, notes, or dependency metadata
- the `--force --reason` form for exceptional dispatch, with the note that an
  evidence event will be recorded

Recovery output must not require reading the lint implementation or an
out-of-band report to fix an ordinary authoring problem.

## Consequences

- FEAT-004 owns the label-based waiver storage and the no-new-schema rule.
- FEAT-010 owns hook insertion in `ExecuteBeadLoopRuntime`, attempt
  classification, and the `OutcomeReason` report field.
- FEAT-011 owns nested workflow-skill packaging so the same rubric guidance can
  be reused by lint, triage, review, breakdown, replay, and benchmark flows.
- Legacy beads can continue running in WARN-ONLY while the queue is baselined.
- Once BLOCK mode is enabled, dispatch quality becomes explicit and auditable
  instead of depending on operator memory.

## Non-Goals

- A new FEAT for bead quality; the existing feature specs own the affected
  surfaces.
- The separate `in_progress` eligibility bug.
- Cross-project skill packaging, which remains deferred to FEAT-015.
- New fields in `.ddx/beads.jsonl`; waivers use labels and evidence events.
